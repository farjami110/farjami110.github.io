                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        My research focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence, mathematics, computer
                        science, and logic, with a particular emphasis on developing logical frameworks for normative
                        reasoning. I am particularly interested in applying deontic logics, which address the logic of
                        obligations and permissions, to create AI systems that are explainable and ethically aligned. My
                        work involves using algebraic and topological models to improve the scalability and
                        comprehensibility of normative systems. This includes developing methodologies such as LogiKEy,
                        which supports ethical reasoning in AI, and applying duality techniques to enhance the
                        computation of rule-based systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am also interested in the emerging field of neuro-symbolic AI, which aims to combine the
                        strengths of neural networks with symbolic reasoning. I have a background in pure mathematics
                        and computer science, having completed my Ph.D. at the University of Luxembourg, where I was
                        part of the <a href="https://icr.uni.lu/" class="styled-link" target="_blank">Individual and
                            Collective
                            Reasoning</a> group. This expertise allows me to
                        integrate
                        theoretical concepts with practical
                        applications, contributing to AI technologies that align with human values and ethics.
