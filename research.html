            <h2>Academic Background</h2>
            <p>I am generally interested in different aspects of logical reasoning, from mathematical modeling and
                abstraction to the mining of logical reasoning and the application of logic in computer science and AI.

                    <strong>Normative Systems: </strong>
                    <p>As a mathematician, I am interested in modeling both natural and social phenomena.
                        While mathematics typically focuses on modeling natural and descriptive systems,
                        I am primarily interested in modeling normative systems and reasoning.</p>

                    <p>A key feature of normative reasoning is non-reflexivity. For instance, just because a statement
                        is true does not necessarily mean it imposes an obligation. <a

                            target="_blank">Nelson Goodman</a>
                        illustrates this
                        concept through his analysis of perspective in art as a symbolic system,
                        which does not inherently possess reflexivity but instead interprets reality
                        through cultural and conventional rules <a
                            href="https://monoskop.org/images/1/1b/Goodman_Nelson_Languages_of_Art.pdf"
                            class="styled-link" target="_blank">(Goodman, 1976)</a>. In my Bachelor's thesis,
                        I used Goodman’s arguments and psychological experiments to support anti-Platonism in relation
                        to mathematical objects.</p>

                    <p>This concept of non-reflexivity extends beyond perception into cognition,
                        as evidenced by phenomena such as <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/KAZHTE"
                            class="styled-link" target="_blank">Moore’s Paradox</a>, where individuals hold
                        contradictory
                        beliefs,
                        and belief update mechanisms, which illustrate how new information is integrated
                        into existing knowledge without necessarily maintaining consistency.
                        My Master's thesis explored <a

                        aiming to abstract this phenomenon through <a

                    <p>During my Ph.D., I focused on <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1004748624537"

                        conditionals. This logic is characterized by a
                        non-reflexive consequence relation, distinct from Tarskian consequence relations.
                        I developed a <a href="https://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/44768" class="styled-link"

                        perspectives
                        simultaneously.</p>

                    <p>Currently, I am working on algebraic and topological models of input/output logic.
                        In collaboration with <a href="https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/alessandra-palmigiano"
                            class="styled-link" target="_blank">Alessandra Palmigiano</a> and her Ph.D. students, we
                        have
                        connected
                        input/output logic
                        with subordination algebras—two areas previously pursued independently.
                        These structures unify constructive and point-free mathematics, non-classical logics,
                        and their applications to the semantics of programming languages.</p>

                    <p>I am interested in exploring questions that span from the mathematical foundations
                        to the modeling of more complex normative systems, such as multi-agent systems, game-theoretic
                        models, and AI.</p>

                    <strong>Neuro-Symbolic System:</strong>
                    <p>I am also interested in finding logical arguments in daily use, such as <a

                            argument
                            schemes</a>. After completing my PhD, I undertook a
                        postdoctoral position at the Computer
                        Engineering
                        Department of the Iran University of Science and Technology. Our core aim was to engineer
                        scalable,
                        explainable AI tools geared towards reasoning with legal knowledge graphs.
                        Specifically, we worked on a hybrid reasoning module that amalgamated a neural model with a
                        logical forward-chaining mechanism.</p>

                    <p>With the rapid growth and evolution of Machine Learning (ML) models and their subsequent AI
                        applications, it is evident that hybrid models can enhance both the scalability of logical
                        reasoning tools and the explainability of neural network outputs. I am particularly interested
                        in mining arguments with neural networks and combining them with abstract rule-based logical
                        systems. Currently, as a postdoctoral researcher, I am working on designing a neuro-symbolic AI
                        system for detecting dark patterns.</p>

                    <strong>Computational Logics: </strong>
                    <p>One of my broad interests is "How to compute logics?" focusing primarily on rule-based logics
                        abstractly represented as input/output logics. To address this question, I have explored both
                        theoretical computer science and automated reasoning, as well as mathematical representational
                        theories like Stone dualities.</p>

                        methodology designed to support the development and experimentation with ethical
                        reasoners, normative theories, and deontic logics.</p>

                    <p>From Logic to (Set-theoretic) Models: The LogiKEy methodology is based on aligning models of the
                        target logic with Henkin models. This is challenging for input/output (I/O) logics, which lack
                        standard models. Thanks to duality techniques and algebraic models for I/O logics (developed
                        together with Alessandra Palmigiano), we could implement I/O logics faithfully in HOL. This
                        research indicates how combining duality techniques with shallow semantical embedding is
                        effective for computing rule-based logical systems.</p>

                    <p>We are currently working on the translation of I/O logics into first-order logic, which will be
                        mainly beneficial for the scalable automation of I/O logics.</p>
